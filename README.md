# Hands-On Python Collections (Data Structures Real World Practice)

This repository contains my hands-on practice from Kaylee Kohfeldt's LinkedIn Learning course focused on Python’s collections module and specialised data structures.

Framed around a restaurant dataset, each guided exercise mirrors real business-related data concerns (e.g. counting, grouping, dedeplicating, aggregating, queuing, and structuring of messy data into usable formats), necessary skills for work in analytics, data engineering, and data science workflows.

### Tools Used
- Python
- GitHub Codespaces (cloud-powered development environment)
- Libraries: collections, csv, string, pprint

### Purpose of this repository

The goal of this course was to:
- Strengthen my understanding of Python
- Practise using data structures for efficiency and readability
- Use Python (instead of Excel) for data cleaning

### Key Python Concepts Practised
+ **Counter**\
  -Counts occurrences, performs arithmetic on counts\
  -Applicable for: Word frequency, product popularity, inventory tracking
+ **deque**\
  -'Double-ended queue' used to quickly add/remove from both ends of a list using append(), appendleft(), pop(), and popleft()\
  -Applicable for: Assessing activity/log recency, task scheduling with priority, checking for palindromes
+ **namedtuple**\
  -Creates structured sequences with named fields\
  -Applicable for: Reading rows from CSV files/database records, storing item details
+ **defaultdict**\
  -Automatically creates a dictionary key if it doesn't exist yet, removing the need to check if it exists first before adding it\
  -Applicable for: Cleaner grouping of data, aggregation
+ **lambda**\
  -Creates an anonymous function (one without a name) on the fly\
  -Applicable for: Simplifying short-term tasks, reducing clutter when defining temporary/throwaway code
